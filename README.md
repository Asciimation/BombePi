# BombePi

This is the source code used in my desktop Turing/Welchman Bombe project.

The desktop Bombe makes use of a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino to create hybrid electromechanical version of the Turing/Welchman Bombe develped at Bletchly Park during WW2 to help break Enigma codes.

The original project is described here: [Turing/Welchman Bombe project](https://web.archive.org/web/20190816231400/http://www.asciimation.co.nz/bb/category/turing-welchman-bombe)

A YouTube film of the machine is available here: [turingwelchmanbombe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmlbNDreLDk)

This IS NOT a running project. It requires very custom, one-off hardware and used external libraries not included here. This code is provided purely for interested parties to examine. It is written in simple C++ and was compiled and run on the Raspberry Pi.

The menu file provided is the same one used at Bletchley Park to demonstrate their recreated Bombe.
